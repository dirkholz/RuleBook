RoboCup German Open 2015
========================

Here you can find various definitions, maps, questions etc used in the German Open 2015

- Retries: Because each team has 3 attempts for each stage 1 challenge, there are no restarts within an attempt. 
- GPSR command generator: https://github.com/kyordhel/GPSRCmdGen2015 (check out the GermanOpen-branch!)
- Manipulation: teams can pick what shelf will be the empty shelf (of shelf #11) on which to place objects
- Speech recognition: will take place in the kitchen-area. [Questions](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/RuleBook/blob/master/GermanOpen2015/speech_recognition/speech_recognition_questions.csv)
- Manipulation: there will be no time to get the PDF from the robot's USB-sticks between tries. Please put a timestamp and team name in the PDF's filename. 
- Restaurant: The rulebook currently states that the **kitchen bar table** is 'next to' the guide phase start/end position. It has not been defined whether this is left or right of the robot. Therefore, teams can choose of which side of the table to start from and thus choose left/right themselves. In China, left or right will be instructed to the robots in a similar way it is done with ordering tables. The rulebook will be updated for this after RGO2015. 
- Open challenge: Because there are so few TCÅ›, the Open challenge will be judged by both TC and Team Leaders.
- RoboNurse: the time for describing pills starts after the robot stopped in front of the shelf. It stops when the robot starts describing the bottles by speech. 
- Restaurant: If a robot's cannot detect a call for attention, it may for example ask at each table whether everything is OK and if they want to order. In that case, there are no points awarded for "Noticing a waving/calling person from distance" and no point for "Going to the table of the waving/calling person".
